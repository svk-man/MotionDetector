train_bottleneck.py:
Choose this method if you train on CPU, or want to train model faster (lower accuracy model). Required a lot of RAM and HDD space.

train.py:
Choose this method if you train on GPU.

If using train.py:
Line 19. Change annotation_path to your file (learned to generate them in previous tutorial).
Line 20. Change log_dir, directory where to save trained model and checkpoints.
Line 21. Change classes_path to your classes file (learned to generate them in previous tutorial).
Line 22. anchors_path, don't change this if you don't know what you are doing.
Line 34. If training new model, leave it as it is "weights_path='model_data/yolo_weights.h5'", otherwise link your checkpoint.
Line 57. batch_size = 32, try to train with this, if you receive some kind of memory error, decrease this number.
Line 76. batch_size = 8, same as in Line 57. I tried to train with gtx1080ti, received memory error while using "batch_size = 32", was able to train with 8.
Lines 63,64 82, 83. Increase epochs count for better model accuracy.

Lines 72,73 86, 87, 105, 106. Increase epochs count for better model accuracy.
After finishing training in your logs file there should be created new "trained_weights_final.h5" model file. This will be used for custom detection.
